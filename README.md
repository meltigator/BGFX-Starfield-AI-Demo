### This demo showcases the capabilities of BGFX - a powerful, cross-platform rendering library.

## Technical Presentation

### Introduction: The Evolution of 3D Demos

Building upon my previous work with Ogre3D (Unix vs Ogre 3D), this new demo showcases the capabilities of BGFX - a powerful, cross-platform rendering library. While Ogre3D demonstrated robust rendering capabilities, this project focuses on dynamic AI behavior within a particle-rich environment.

## Key Features & Advancements

1. Intelligent Sphere Agent

    * AI Navigation System: Autonomous sphere that navigates through 150 animated cubes

    * Behavior State Machine: 7 distinct movement patterns (forward, backward, left, right, up, down, random)

    * Collision Avoidance: Real-time obstacle detection and evasion algorithms

    * Organic Movement Patterns: Smooth acceleration/deceleration with momentum physics

2. Enhanced Visual Effects

    * Dynamic Pulsation System: Size oscillation with configurable frequency

    * Energy Aura: Glowing halo effect during high-intensity states

    * Core Energy System: Multi-layered internal energy source with color transitions

    * Motion Trails: Velocity-based particle trails

3. Performance Optimization

    * BGFX Rendering: Cross-platform, graphics API-agnostic rendering

    * Efficient Geometry: Quad strips for sphere rendering

    * Dynamic LOD: Adjustable detail levels for effects

    * Multithreaded Compilation: Utilizes all CPU cores


## AI Behavior System

The intelligent sphere features a sophisticated decision-making process:

### Action Selection (every 1-4 seconds):

    actions = ["random", "forward", "backward", "left", "right", "up", "down"]
    current_action = weighted_choice(actions, weights=[0.2, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])

### Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm:

    for (const auto& cube : cubes) {
    float distance = calculate_distance(sphere, cube);
    if (distance < avoidance_radius) {
        avoidance_vector -= (cube.position - sphere.position).normalized() 
                            * (1.0 - distance/avoidance_radius);
    }
    
### Movement Physics:

    velocity += direction * movement_speed * delta_time;
    velocity = clamp(velocity, max_speed);
    position += velocity * delta_time;
    velocity *= 0.92f; // Friction factor

## Visual Effects Breakdown

### Sphere Rendering Pipeline:

    1.Base Sphere:

        - 16 slices × 16 stacks geometry

        - Dynamic lighting based on surface normal

        - Blue energy gradient

    2.Pulsation Effect:
    
        scale = base_size * (0.7 + 0.5 * sin(time * pulsation_speed));
    
    3.Energy Core:

         - Dual-color state system (yellow ↔ white)

         - Radial stripe pattern

         - Size synchronized with pulsation

    4.Aura Effect:
   
         - 150% size transparent sphere

         - Only active during high-intensity states

         - Alpha-blended rendering
