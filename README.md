### Introduction: The Evolution of 3D Demos

Building upon my previous work with Ogre3D (Unix vs Ogre 3D), this new demo showcases the capabilities of BGFX - a powerful, cross-platform rendering library. While Ogre3D demonstrated robust rendering capabilities, this project focuses on dynamic AI behavior within a particle-rich environment.

## Key Features & Advancements

1. Intelligent Sphere Agent

    * AI Navigation System: Autonomous sphere that navigates through 150 animated cubes

    * Behavior State Machine: 7 distinct movement patterns (forward, backward, left, right, up, down, random)

    * Collision Avoidance: Real-time obstacle detection and evasion algorithms

    * Organic Movement Patterns: Smooth acceleration/deceleration with momentum physics

2. Enhanced Visual Effects

    Dynamic Pulsation System: Size oscillation with configurable frequency

    Energy Aura: Glowing halo effect during high-intensity states

    Core Energy System: Multi-layered internal energy source with color transitions

    Motion Trails: Velocity-based particle trails

3. Performance Optimization

    BGFX Rendering: Cross-platform, graphics API-agnostic rendering

    Efficient Geometry: Quad strips for sphere rendering

    Dynamic LOD: Adjustable detail levels for effects

    Multithreaded Compilation: Utilizes all CPU cores
